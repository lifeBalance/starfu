# Negroni

The drink you order to prove you have *taste*, even if you’re still figuring out what Campari is.

## Ingredients

* 1 oz gin (something respectable)
* 1 oz Campari (embrace the bitterness)
* 1 oz sweet vermouth
* Orange peel
* Ice (big cubes if you want to feel superior)

## Instructions

1. Fill a mixing glass with ice. Be generous.

2. Add gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth.

3. Stir for about 20–30 seconds. This is a calm drink. No shaking tantrums.

4. Strain over a large ice cube in a rocks glass.

5. Express an orange peel over the glass, drop it in, look smug.

6. Take a sip. Decide whether you love it or need to lie about it.

## Variations

### Boulevardier

Swap gin for bourbon. Suddenly it’s autumn and you own leather boots.

### Negroni Sbagliato

Replace gin with prosecco. Congratulations, you’ve made brunch dangerous.

## Tips

* Equal parts matter. This is not the time to freestyle.
* If it tastes “too bitter,” congratulations—you made it correctly.
* Gets better as the ice melts. Unlike most things in life.

## Yield

Makes 1 sophisticated personality for 30 minutes
