# Gin & Tonic

Deceptively simple. Devastatingly refreshing. Impossible to mess up (and yet people do).

## Ingredients

- 2 oz gin
- 4-5 oz quality tonic water
- Lime wedge (or get fancy with cucumber, grapefruit, or herbs)
- Ice

## Instructions

1. Fill a highball glass with ice. Good ice. Lots of it.

2. Pour in the gin.

3. Top with tonic water. Pour it gently down the side of the glass to preserve the bubbles.

4. Give it ONE gentle stir. The tonic is carbonated. Respect it.

5. Squeeze in a lime wedge and drop it in.

6. Drink immediately while those bubbles are alive.

## The Tonic Matters

Cheap tonic will ruin good gin. This is a two-ingredient drink—both ingredients need to pull their weight. Fever-Tree, Q Tonic, or similar. Your supermarket tonic has its place, and that place is not here.

## Garnish Ideas

- **Classic**: Lime wedge
- **Spanish style**: Orange slice + rosemary
- **Cucumber**: Cool and refreshing
- **Grapefruit**: Bitter and bright
- **Juniper berries**: For the gin nerds

## Tips

- The ratio is flexible. Start with 1:2 gin to tonic and adjust.
- Cold glass, cold tonic, lots of ice
- Different gins want different garnishes. Experiment.

## Yield

Makes 1 effortlessly elegant refreshment
