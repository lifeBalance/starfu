# Martini

The most argued-about drink in existence. Let's add fuel to the fire.

## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 oz gin (or vodka if you must)
- 1/2 oz dry vermouth
- Lemon twist or olives for garnish

## Instructions

1. Chill your martini glass in the freezer. A warm martini is a sad martini.

2. Add gin and vermouth to a mixing glass with ice.

3. Stir for 30 seconds. Stirring, not shaking, keeps it silky.

4. Strain into your chilled glass.

5. Garnish with a lemon twist (expressed over the drink) or olives.

6. Feel immediately more sophisticated.

## The Great Debates

### Gin or Vodka?
Gin is traditional. Vodka is... fine. Choose your side.

### Shaken or Stirred?
Stirred. Always stirred. Shaking bruises the gin and waters it down. James Bond was a spy, not a bartender.

### How Dry?
- **Wet**: Equal parts gin and vermouth
- **Standard**: 5:1 ratio
- **Dry**: Just a rinse of vermouth
- **Extra Dry**: Wave the vermouth bottle near the glass

### Dirty?
Add olive brine. It's not traditional but it's delicious.

## Tips

- Everything must be ice cold
- Use good vermouth, and keep it in the fridge
- The glass matters—a proper martini glass is part of the experience
