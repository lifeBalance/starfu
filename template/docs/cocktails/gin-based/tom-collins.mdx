4. Top with club soda.

5. Garnish with a lemon wheel and cherry.

## The Collins Family

Tom has relatives:
- **John Collins**: Made with bourbon
- **Vodka Collins**: Made with... you guessed it
- **Juan Collins**: Made with tequila

They all went to the same school.

## Tips

- Fresh lemon juice is mandatory
- Top with soda gently to keep the fizz
- Drink it quickly—it doesn't age well

## History

Named after a 19th-century bartender at Limmer's Hotel in London. Or it's named after a joke. Cocktail history is murky. The drink is clear.
