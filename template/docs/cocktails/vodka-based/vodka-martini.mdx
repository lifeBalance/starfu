# Vodka Martini

For purists who want to argue, and people who just want a cold drink.

## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 oz vodka (the good stuff—there's nowhere to hide)
- 1/2 oz dry vermouth (adjust to taste)
- Lemon twist or olives for garnish
- Ice

## Instructions

1. Chill your martini glass. Put it in the freezer. Forget about it for 10 minutes.

2. Add vodka and vermouth to a mixing glass filled with ice.

3. Stir for 30 seconds. Smooth, elegant circles.

4. Strain into your chilled glass.

5. Garnish with a lemon twist (give it a good twist over the drink) or olives.

6. Sip slowly. Look mysterious.

## The Debate

Yes, James Bond orders his shaken. Yes, gin purists will judge you. No, it doesn't matter. Drink what you like.

## Dry Spectrum

- **Wet**: 2:1 vodka to vermouth
- **Standard**: 5:1
- **Dry**: 8:1 or just a rinse
- **Desert Dry**: Think about vermouth. Don't add it.

## Tips

- Cold is everything. Glass, vodka, everything.
- Good vodka matters here—you're tasting it neat, basically
- Stirring keeps it silky; shaking makes it colder but cloudier

## Yield

Makes 1 exercise in minimalism
