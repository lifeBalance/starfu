# Moscow Mule

The drink that launched a thousand copper mugs.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz vodka
- 4-6 oz ginger beer
- 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
- Lime wheel for garnish
- Ice
- A copper mug (technically optional but come on)

## Instructions

1. Fill your copper mug (or highball glass) with ice.

2. Add vodka and lime juice.

3. Top with ginger beer.

4. Stir gently.

5. Garnish with a lime wheel.

6. Hold the cold copper mug. Feel fancy.

## The Copper Mug Thing

Does the mug make it taste better? Debatable. Does it make you feel cooler? Absolutely. The copper stays cold, your hand stays warm, everyone's happy.

## Ginger Beer Selection

Spicier is better. Look for:
- Fever-Tree
- Bundaberg
- Reed's Extra Ginger

The more ginger bite, the better the mule.

## Variations

### Kentucky Mule
Swap vodka for bourbon. Suddenly it's fall.

### Mexican Mule
Swap vodka for tequila. Olé.

### Dark 'n' Stormy
Swap vodka for dark rum. Bermuda vibes.

## Tips

- Fresh lime juice. Always.
- The ratio is flexible—more ginger beer if you want it lighter
- The copper mug isn't just for show (okay, it's mostly for show)

## Yield

Makes 1 refreshingly spicy kick
