# Espresso Martini

For when you want caffeine and bad ideas at the same time.

## Ingredients

* 2 oz vodka
* 1 oz coffee liqueur
* 1 oz fresh espresso (yes, fresh)
* Ice
* 3 coffee beans for garnish (optional but dramatic)

## Instructions

1. Add everything to a shaker filled with ice.

2. Shake *hard* for 20 seconds. You want foam, not excuses.

3. Strain into a chilled coupe.

4. Garnish with coffee beans if you’re feeling fancy.

5. Sip carefully. This drink has plans.

## Variations

### Vanilla Espresso Martini

Add a splash of vanilla syrup. Cozy chaos.

### Tequila Espresso Martini

Swap vodka for tequila. Question your choices later.

## Tips

* Old coffee ruins everything.
* Shake harder than you think.
* This is not a dessert. It’s a warning.

## Yield

Makes 1 late night inevitable
