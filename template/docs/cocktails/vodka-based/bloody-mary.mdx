# Bloody Mary

The only socially acceptable way to drink before noon.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz vodka
- 4 oz tomato juice
- 1/2 oz fresh lemon juice
- 2-3 dashes Worcestershire sauce
- 2-3 dashes hot sauce (Tabasco, Cholula, whatever you've got)
- Pinch of salt and pepper
- Pinch of celery salt
- Horseradish (optional but encouraged)
- Ice
- Celery stalk, olives, lemon wedge, bacon, shrimp, a whole burger... (garnish has no limits)

## Instructions

1. Add all liquid ingredients to a shaker with ice.

2. Roll (don't shake!) by pouring back and forth between shaker tins. Shaking makes it foamy and weird.

3. Strain into a highball glass over fresh ice.

4. Season with salt, pepper, and celery salt.

5. Garnish with whatever your heart desires. The crazier, the better.

## The Garnish Arms Race

A Bloody Mary garnish can be:
- Simple: Celery stalk and lemon
- Moderate: Olives, pickles, celery, bacon
- Excessive: All of the above plus shrimp, cheese, a slider, onion rings
- Wisconsin: A whole meal on a stick

Go big or go home.

## Mix Your Own vs. Store-Bought

Making your own mix is better. Store-bought is fine. We won't judge.

Quick mix: Tomato juice + Worcestershire + hot sauce + lemon + horseradish + salt + pepper. Done.

## Tips

- Roll, don't shake
- Horseradish adds a nice kick
- This is a "meal" if you garnish it right

## Yield

Makes 1 breakfast cocktail (it has vegetables!)
