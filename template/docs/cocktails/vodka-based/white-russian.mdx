# White Russian

The Dude abides. So should you.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz vodka
- 1 oz coffee liqueur (Kahlúa is classic)
- 1 oz heavy cream (or half-and-half)
- Ice

## Instructions

1. Fill a rocks glass with ice.

2. Pour in vodka and coffee liqueur.

3. Float the cream on top by pouring it slowly over the back of a spoon.

4. Stir if you want. Don't if you want to watch the cream swirl.

5. Put on The Big Lebowski.

## The Cream Situation

- **Heavy cream**: Rich, decadent, the way The Dude intended
- **Half-and-half**: Lighter, still good
- **Milk**: Works but less luxurious
- **Oat milk**: For the lactose intolerant Dudes out there

## Variations

### Black Russian
Skip the cream. Just vodka and coffee liqueur. Darker times.

### Mudslide
Add Irish cream. Dessert in a glass.

### Colorado Bulldog
Top with a splash of cola. Chaotic but delicious.

## Tips

- Good coffee liqueur matters—Kahlúa, Mr. Black, or similar
- Don't over-stir if you want that layered look
- This is basically dessert. Own it.

## The Big Lebowski Connection

The Dude drinks nine White Russians in the movie. We're not saying you should do this. We're not saying you shouldn't.

## Yield

Makes 1 very chill experience
