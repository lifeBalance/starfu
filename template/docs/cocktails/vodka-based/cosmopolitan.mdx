# Cosmopolitan

The 1990s called. They want their drink back. We're keeping it.

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 oz citrus vodka (or regular vodka + extra lime)
- 1 oz Cointreau
- 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
- 1 oz cranberry juice
- Orange peel for garnish

## Instructions

1. Add vodka, Cointreau, lime juice, and cranberry juice to a shaker with ice.

2. Shake until very cold, about 15 seconds.

3. Strain into a chilled martini glass.

4. Express an orange peel over the drink and drop it in.

5. Channel your inner Carrie Bradshaw.

## The SATC Effect

Yes, this drink owes its fame to Sex and the City. Yes, people dismissed it as a "girly drink" for years. Yes, those people were wrong. It's a well-balanced, delicious cocktail. Gender has nothing to do with it.

## The Color

Should be a sophisticated pale pink, not bright red. If it looks like Hawaiian Punch, you added too much cranberry.

## Tips

- Citrus vodka makes it better, but it's not essential
- Just a splash of cranberry—it's for color and a hint of tartness
- The orange peel garnish adds aroma that makes the drink

## Variations

### White Cosmopolitan
Use white cranberry juice. Fancy.

### Elderflower Cosmo
Swap Cointreau for St-Germain. Floral and sophisticated.

## Yield

Makes 1 delicious cultural artifact
