# Margarita

The official drink of "I'm on vacation" even when you're absolutely not.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz tequila (blanco, 100% agave, please have some self-respect)
- 1 oz fresh lime juice (fresh. FRESH. Put down the bottle.)
- 1 oz Cointreau or triple sec
- Salt for the rim
- Lime wheel for garnish
- Ice

## Instructions

1. Run a lime wedge around the rim of your glass. Dip it in salt. Feel fancy.

2. Fill a shaker with ice. Add tequila, lime juice, and Cointreau.

3. Shake vigorously for 15-20 seconds. Pretend you're angry at something.

4. Strain into your salt-rimmed glass over fresh ice.

5. Garnish with a lime wheel.

6. Put on some music. You've earned this.

## Variations

### Spicy Margarita
Add 2-3 slices of jalapeño to the shaker. Live dangerously.

### Frozen Margarita
Blend everything with ice. No judgment here. Okay, a little judgment.

### Skinny Margarita
Skip the Cointreau, add a splash of agave. Instagram will love you.

## Tips

- Never, ever use margarita mix. We're better than this.
- Fresh lime juice is non-negotiable. Bottled lime juice is a crime.
- Good tequila doesn't need to hide. Let it shine.
- The salt rim is optional but highly recommended

## Yield

Makes 1 ticket to temporary happiness
