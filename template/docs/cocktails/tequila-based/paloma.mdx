# Paloma

Mexico's actual favorite tequila drink. Sorry, Margarita.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz tequila blanco
- 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
- Grapefruit soda (Jarritos, Squirt, or Fever-Tree)
- Pinch of salt
- Lime wedge for garnish
- Salt for the rim (optional)

## Instructions

1. If you want a salt rim, do that thing now. You know the drill.

2. Fill a highball glass with ice.

3. Add tequila and lime juice.

4. Add a pinch of salt directly to the drink. Stir.

5. Top with grapefruit soda.

6. Garnish with a lime wedge.

7. Wonder why you've been drinking margaritas all this time.

## The Grapefruit Situation

Fresh grapefruit juice + club soda is the "proper" way. Grapefruit soda is the "delicious" way. We won't judge.

If going fresh:
- 2 oz fresh grapefruit juice
- Club soda to top
- 1/2 oz simple syrup

## Variations

### Spicy Paloma
Muddle jalapeño or add tajín to the rim. Mexican heat.

### Mezcal Paloma
Swap tequila for mezcal. Smoky and sophisticated.

## Tips

- Tequila blanco is traditional. Reposado works too.
- The salt IN the drink (not just on the rim) is key
- This is dangerously easy to drink. Pace yourself.

## History

"Paloma" means "dove" in Spanish. Nobody knows why. Just accept it.
