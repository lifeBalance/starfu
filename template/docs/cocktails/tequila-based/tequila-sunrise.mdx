# Tequila Sunrise

The drink that looks like a sunset. Named by someone who clearly stays up too late.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz tequila blanco
- 4 oz fresh orange juice
- 1/2 oz grenadine (real grenadine, not red sugar water)
- Orange slice and cherry for garnish
- Ice

## Instructions

1. Fill a highball glass with ice.

2. Add tequila and orange juice. Stir gently.

3. Slowly pour grenadine down the side of the glass. Watch it sink to the bottom and create that gradient. This is the whole point.

4. DO NOT STIR. The layers are the aesthetic.

5. Garnish with an orange slice and cherry.

6. Take a photo for Instagram. You've earned it.

## The Grenadine Matters

Real grenadine is made from pomegranates. That bright red syrup from the grocery store is mostly corn syrup and food coloring. It works, but it's not the same. Make your own or buy the good stuff.

## Quick Homemade Grenadine

- 1 cup pomegranate juice
- 1 cup sugar
- Heat until sugar dissolves. Cool. Done.

## Tips

- Fresh orange juice makes a real difference here
- The grenadine MUST be poured slowly for the effect
- This is basically acceptable morning drinking if you think about it

## History

Became famous in the 1970s thanks to the Eagles song. The drink predates the song. The hangover predates both.

Makes 1 Instagrammable moment
