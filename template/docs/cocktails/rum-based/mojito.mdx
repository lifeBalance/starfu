# Mojito

Cuba's gift to humanity. Hemingway's favorite. Your new personality. Proof that mint deserves respect and not whatever you’ve been doing to it.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz white rum
- 1 oz fresh lime juice
- 2 teaspoons sugar (or 3/4 oz simple syrup)
- 6-8 fresh mint leaves (plus a sprig for garnish)
- Soda water
- Ice
- A sense of tropical optimism

## Instructions

1. Place mint leaves in the bottom of a highball glass. Add sugar and lime juice.

2. Muddle gently. You're coaxing flavor out, not making a smoothie. Be nice to the mint.

3. Fill the glass with ice.

4. Pour in the rum. Watch it disappear into the ice like your problems are about to.

5. Top with soda water. Give it a gentle stir.

6. Garnish with a mint sprig. Slap it once between your palms to release the aroma. Look cool doing it.

7. Insert a straw. Transport yourself to Havana.

## Tips

- Muddle gently! Brutalizing the mint makes it bitter and you'll taste it.
- Use good white rum. Cuban if you can get it.
- The mint slap is essential. Trust the process.
- This drink is best consumed immediately. The mint doesn't age gracefully.

## Common Mistakes

- Over-muddling (we cannot stress this enough)
- Using dried mint (absolutely not)
- Forgetting the soda water (it's not a mint julep)
- Making only one (always make two)

## History

Supposedly invented in the 1500s as a medicinal drink. We're not doctors but we prescribe this for everything.

## Variations

### Strawberry Mojito

Add fresh strawberries. Summer energy.

### Dark Rum Mojito

Break tradition. Feel rebellious.

## Tips

* Shredded mint = sad drink.
* Fresh mint only. Dried mint is for regrets.
* This drink is refreshing, not sweet.
