# Dark 'n' Stormy

Two ingredients. One perfect combination. Bermuda's gift to the drinking world.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz dark rum (Gosling's Black Seal is traditional)
- 4-5 oz ginger beer (not ginger ale—GINGER BEER)
- Lime wedge
- Ice

## Instructions

1. Fill a highball glass with ice.

2. Pour in ginger beer.

3. Float the dark rum on top by pouring it slowly over the back of a spoon.

4. Watch the dark rum float on the ginger beer like storm clouds. That's the whole point.

5. Squeeze in a lime wedge and drop it in.

6. Give it a gentle stir when you're ready to drink (or don't—live dangerously).

## The Trademark Situation

Fun fact: "Dark 'n' Stormy" is trademarked by Gosling's. Legally, it's only a Dark 'n' Stormy if it's made with Gosling's rum.

Will anyone arrest you for using different rum? No. But you'll know.

## Ginger Beer vs. Ginger Ale

- **Ginger beer**: Spicy, bold, has bite
- **Ginger ale**: Sweet, mild, for cowards

Use ginger beer. The spicier, the better.

## Tips

- The float is aesthetic AND functional—you taste rum first, then ginger
- Fresh lime is essential
- More ginger beer = more refreshing, less boozy

## Variations

### Darker 'n' Stormier
Add more rum. You're an adult.

### Bermuda Mule
Same thing in a copper mug. Marketing.

## Yield

Makes 1 perfectly stormy situation
