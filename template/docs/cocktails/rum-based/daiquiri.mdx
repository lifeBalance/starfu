# Daiquiri

Not the frozen gas station slushie. The real thing. Three ingredients. Perfect balance.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz white rum
- 1 oz fresh lime juice
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- Lime wheel for garnish

## Instructions

1. Add rum, lime juice, and simple syrup to a shaker with ice.

2. Shake vigorously for 15 seconds. Make it cold.

3. Strain into a chilled coupe glass.

4. Garnish with a lime wheel.

5. Sip. Wonder why you ever ordered a frozen one.

## The Frozen Daiquiri Situation

Look, frozen daiquiris are fine. They're fun. They're vacation. But they're not *this*. This is elegant. This is what Hemingway drank (along with everything else).

If you want frozen, we won't stop you. But try this first.

## Variations

### Hemingway Daiquiri (Papa Doble)

- 1/2 oz grapefruit juice
- 1/4 oz maraschino liqueur
- No sugar (Hemingway was diabetic)

### Strawberry Daiquiri (The Real Way)
Muddle fresh strawberries, then proceed as normal. Not a slushie.

## Tips

- Fresh lime juice. Always.
- Shake it until the shaker frosts over
