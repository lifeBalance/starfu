# Pina Colada

If you like getting caught in the rain, this is your drink.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz white rum
- 2 oz coconut cream (not coconut milk, not coconut water—CREAM)
- 2 oz pineapple juice
- 1 cup ice
- Pineapple wedge and cherry for garnish
- A tiny umbrella (mandatory)

## Instructions

1. Add rum, coconut cream, pineapple juice, and ice to a blender.

2. Blend until smooth. Listen to the sound of vacation.

3. Pour into a hurricane glass or whatever large glass you have.

4. Garnish with pineapple, cherry, and absolutely a tiny umbrella.

5. Put on some beach sounds. Close your eyes. You're not at work.

## The Coconut Cream Debate

- **Coco López**: The classic. Sweet, rich, perfect.
- **Coconut milk**: Too thin. Your drink will be sad.
- **Fresh coconut**: Impressive but unnecessary.

Coco López or equivalent coconut cream. Accept no substitutes.

## Shaken Version

Don't have a blender? Shame. But you can shake it:
- Shake everything with ice
- Strain over crushed ice
- It's not the same but it works

## Tips

- Freeze your glass beforehand
- More coconut cream = richer drink
- This is not a "healthy" drink. Embrace it.

## History

Invented in Puerto Rico. There's a plaque. It's a whole thing. Puerto Rico takes this seriously.

## Yield

Makes 1 tropical state of mind
