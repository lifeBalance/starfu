# The Cocktail Compendium

Welcome, fellow enthusiast of liquid courage.

You've stumbled upon humanity's greatest achievement: the art of mixing alcohol with other things to make it taste like you're not making questionable life decisions.

## Why Cocktails?

Because drinking straight liquor makes you look like you're going through something. A cocktail says "I'm sophisticated and have my life together" even when you absolutely do not.

## How to Use This Guide

Each recipe is organized by base spirit, because after a few drinks, that's probably all you'll remember anyway.

- **Whiskey** — For when you want to feel like a 1920s detective
- **Vodka** — For when you want to taste everything except the alcohol
- **Tequila** — For decisions you'll blame on someone else tomorrow
- **Rum** — For pretending you're on vacation
- **Gin** — For botanical enlightenment

## Essential Equipment

- A shaker (or a jar with a lid, we don't judge)
- A jigger (or just eyeball it like a rebel)
- A strainer (or steady hands and optimism)
- Ice (non-negotiable)
- A glass (mandatory)
- A friend to impress (optional but recommended)

## The Golden Rules

1. **Fresh citrus always.** Bottled juice is for cowards.
2. **Good ice matters.** Cloudy ice from your freezer works, but clear ice makes you look like you know things.
3. **Taste as you go.** It's quality control, not drinking alone.
4. **When in doubt, add more lime.** This solves most problems, cocktail-related or otherwise.

Now pick a spirit and let's get dangerous.
