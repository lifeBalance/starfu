# Old Fashioned

The granddaddy of all cocktails. If Don Draper drank it, you should too.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz bourbon or rye whiskey
- 1 sugar cube (or 1/2 tsp simple syrup)
- 2-3 dashes Angostura bitters
- Orange peel
- Ice (the big fancy cube if you're feeling classy)
- Luxardo cherry (optional, but are you even living?)

## Instructions

1. Place the sugar cube in a rocks glass. Douse it with bitters like it owes you money.

2. Add a tiny splash of water. Muddle until the sugar surrenders.

3. Add a large ice cube. The bigger, the better. We're not animals.

4. Pour in the whiskey. Watch it cascade over the ice. Beautiful.

5. Express the orange peel over the drink by holding it over the glass and giving it a good twist. The oils should spritz onto the surface.

6. Drop the peel in. Add a cherry if you're feeling fancy.

7. Stir gently. Contemplate your life choices.

## Tips

- Use good whiskey. This isn't a drink to hide bad liquor.
- Don't you dare use maraschino cherries from a jar. Luxardo or nothing.
- The sugar cube is traditional, but simple syrup integrates better
- Make it at home and pretend you're in a speakeasy

## History

Invented in the 1880s, this is quite literally an "old fashioned" way to make a cocktail. It's survived prohibition, disco, and the invention of the appletini. Respect.
