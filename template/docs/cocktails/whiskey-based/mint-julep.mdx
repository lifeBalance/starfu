# Mint Julep

The Kentucky Derby's official drink. Wear a big hat while drinking it.

## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 oz bourbon
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 8-10 fresh mint leaves
- Crushed ice (this is non-negotiable)
- Mint sprig for garnish

## Instructions

1. Place mint leaves and simple syrup in a julep cup (or rocks glass if you're not fancy).

2. Muddle gently. You're waking up the mint, not murdering it.

3. Pack the cup tightly with crushed ice. Really pack it in there.

4. Pour bourbon over the ice.

5. Stir until the cup gets frosty on the outside. This is the moment.

6. Add more crushed ice to form a dome on top.

7. Garnish with a generous mint sprig. Slap it first to release the oils.

8. Add a short straw so your nose is in the mint when you sip.

## The Crushed Ice Situation

This drink lives or dies by crushed ice. Use a Lewis bag and mallet, a blender, or just attack some ice with a rolling pin. The finer, the better.

## Tips

- A metal julep cup isn't just for show—it frosts up beautifully
- The straw placement matters. Your nose should be in the mint.
- More mint is always the answer

## When to Drink

- The Kentucky Derby (mandatory)
- Hot summer days
- When you want to feel like Southern aristocracy

## Yield

Makes 1 ticket to the antebellum South
