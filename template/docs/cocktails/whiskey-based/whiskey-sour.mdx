# Whiskey Sour

The drink that taught us citrus and whiskey are soulmates.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz bourbon
- 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 1 egg white (optional, but you want that foam)
- Angostura bitters for garnish
- Cherry and orange slice for garnish

## Instructions

1. If using egg white, add all ingredients to a shaker WITHOUT ice. Shake vigorously for 15 seconds. This is called a "dry shake" and creates that beautiful foam.

2. Add ice to the shaker. Shake again for another 15 seconds.

3. Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice (or serve "up" in a coupe).

4. Add a few drops of Angostura bitters on top of the foam. Drag a toothpick through them to make pretty patterns if you're feeling artistic.

5. Garnish with a cherry and orange slice.

## The Egg White Debate

Yes, you're drinking raw egg. No, you probably won't die. The alcohol helps. The foam is worth it. Live a little.

If you're truly terrified, aquafaba (chickpea water) works too. We won't tell anyone.

## Tips

- Fresh lemon juice. Always. Forever. We will not discuss bottled.
- The dry shake is essential for proper foam
- A Boston shaker works better than a cobbler for egg white drinks

## Yield
