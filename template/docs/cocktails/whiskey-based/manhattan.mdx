# Manhattan

New York in a glass. Sophisticated, bold, and slightly intimidating.

## Ingredients

- 2 oz rye whiskey (bourbon works, but rye is traditional)
- 1 oz sweet vermouth
- 2-3 dashes Angostura bitters
- Luxardo cherry for garnish

## Instructions

1. Add whiskey, vermouth, and bitters to a mixing glass with ice.

2. Stir for about 30 seconds. We stir, not shake. James Bond was wrong about everything.

3. Strain into a chilled coupe or martini glass.

4. Garnish with a cherry. Drop it in like you mean it.

## Variations

### Perfect Manhattan
Use equal parts sweet and dry vermouth. For the indecisive.

### Rob Roy
Same thing but with Scotch. For when you want to feel Scottish.

### Black Manhattan
Swap sweet vermouth for Averna amaro. Dark and mysterious.

## Tips

- Chill your glass in the freezer beforehand
- Sweet vermouth goes bad! Keep it in the fridge after opening
- Rye gives it that classic spicy kick

## History

Allegedly invented at the Manhattan Club in NYC in the 1870s. Like most cocktail origin stories, this is probably a lie, but it's a good one.

## Yield

Makes 1 power move in a glass
