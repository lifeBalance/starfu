# Writing Docs

This page explains how to add and organize your documentation content.

## Starter Content

The scaffold includes three documentation sections as examples:

- **Tutorial** — The docs you're reading now (self-documentation)
- **Pancakes** — A silly recipe section
- **Cocktails** — Another demo section

These exist to show how Starfu works. You'll probably want to **delete them** and add your own content:

```sh
rm -rf docs/tutorial docs/pancakes docs/cocktails
```

Then update `.starfu/astro.config.mjs` to remove their section entries.

## Adding Your Own Docs

Documentation folders can live **anywhere** in your project. You just need to:

1. Create a folder with `.mdx` or `.md` files
2. Register it as a section in `.starfu/astro.config.mjs`

For example, let's create a `gardening` folder, with a `tulip.mdx` file:

```sh
your-project/
  ├── .starfu/      # The Astro engine (treat as tooling)
  └── gardening/      # Your doc files go here.
    ├── _toc.ts       # The Table Of Contents.
    └── tulips.mdx    # Your markdown/mdx content goes here.
```

The `_toc.ts` looks like this:

```ts
export default [{ path: 'tulips', label: 'How to grow tulips' }]
```

Then, in `.starfu/astro.config.mjs`, let's wire up the docs:

```js
docsIntegration({
  title: 'Starfu',
  sections: [
    {
      root: `../gardening`,       // Path to docs folder (relative to this file)
      title: 'Gardening Guides',  // Card title on landing page
      subtitle: 'How to grow stuff', // Card subtitle
      href: '/gardening/tulips',  // Entry point (first page to show)
    },
  ],
})
```

<Admonition type="warning">
The `root` path is relative to the location of `.starfu/astro.config.mjs`.
</Admonition>

This flexibility lets you:

- Keep docs next to your code.
- Share docs across multiple projects.
- Organize however makes sense for your project.

### Section Config Fields

| Field      | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `root`     | Path to the docs folder, relative to `.starfu/` |
| `title`    | Section title shown on the landing page card      |
| `subtitle` | Short description shown on the card               |
| `href`     | URL path to the section's entry page              |


## Multiple Sections

Add as many sections as you need:

```js
sections: [
  {
    root: `../gardening`,
    title: 'Gardening Guides',
    subtitle: 'How to grow stuff',
    href: '/gardening/tulips',
  },
  {
    root: '../docs/api',
    title: 'API Reference',
    subtitle: 'Function and type docs',
    href: '/api/overview',
  },
  {
    root: '../docs/examples',
    title: 'Examples',
    subtitle: 'Code samples and recipes',
    href: '/examples/basic',
  },
],
```

Each section gets its own:

- Landing page card
- Sidebar navigation
- Table of contents (`_toc.ts`)

## The TOC Files

The `_toc.ts` files are where you organize your documentation:

```js
export default [
  { path: 'intro', label: 'Introduction' },
  { path: 'docs/', label: 'Writing Docs' },
]
```

- The `path` property specifies the path to the folder (note the **trailing slash**) or to the file (no extension needed).
- The `label` is just the title in the sidebar.

These files are used to automatically generate the sidebar.
