# Introduction

[Starfu](https://github.com/lifeBalance/starfu) is two things:

- An [Astro integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) for building **multi-section documentation sites**. You get a **landing page**, which cards linking to each section. Each section gets its own table of contents.
- A `starfu` CLI to scaffold the template mentioned above.

## Why Starfu?

Most documentation tools force all content into a **single hierarchy**. Starfu lets you organize content into independent sections—perfect for:

- **Learning paths** with distinct topics (Basics, Advanced, Patterns)
- **Product docs** with separate guides for different features
- **Multi-project docs** under one site

Each section is self-contained with its own sidebar navigation, but they all share a unified landing page.

## Key Features

- **Multiple sections** — Each section has independent `_toc.ts` control.
- **Easy navigation** — Prev/next links, breadcrumbs, and sidebar access.
- **Smart routing** — Section/group URLs redirect to first content page
- **Landing page cards** — Auto-generated from section metadata.
- **Full-text search** — Powered by [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/).
- **Dark mode** — Built-in theme toggle.
- **GitHub Pages ready** — Base path configured automatically.

## Quick Start

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
  <TabItem label="pnpm (recommended)">
    ```sh
    pnpm dlx starfu
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```sh
    npx starfu
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

That's it. You'll be guided through:

## What You Get

After scaffolding, you'll get something like this:

```sh
your-project/
  ├── .starfu/     # The Astro engine (treat as tooling)
  └── docs/          # Your markdown/mdx content goes here
```

<Admonition>
 The `docs/` folder include some documentation sections just for illustrative purposes. You're supposed to replace them with your stuff.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" title="VS Code Users">
If you open the project before installing dependencies, you may see a TypeScript error about `astro/tsconfigs/strict` not found. This is safe to ignore—it disappears after running `pnpm install`. If the error persists, run **Developer: Reload Window** from the command palette.
</Admonition>

Each sections is configured in `.starfu/astro.config.mjs`:

```js
docsIntegration({
  title: 'My Docs',
  sections: [
    {
      root: '../docs/my-section',       // Location in fileystem
      title: 'My Section',              // Title
      subtitle: 'Getting started guide',// Subtitle
      href: '/my-section/intro',        // Entry point to docs (file)
    },
  ],
})
```

## Local Development Server

Run the dev server from `.starfu/`:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
  <TabItem label="pnpm (recommended)">
    ```bash
    cd .starfu
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    cd .starfu
    npm run dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your docs are served **locally** at `http://localhost:4321/<repo-name>/`. Edit your docs, and see changes in real-time.
