# Starfu CLI

[Starfu](https://github.com/lifeBalance/starfu) is a **scaffolding tool** that creates documentation sites powered by Astro. It sets up a complete docs environment with minimal configuration.

## What It Does

Running `npx starfu` in your project:

```sh
┌  Starfu
│
◆  Site title:
│  my-project
│
◇  Scaffolding complete!
│
●  Detected: github.com/username/my-project
│
◆  Install dependencies?
│  ● Yes  ○ No
│
◇  Dependencies installed!
│
◆  Generate Pagefind search index?
│  ● Yes  ○ No
│
◇  Search index generated!
│
◆  Wanna spin up a dev server?
│  ● Yes  ○ No
│
└  Starting dev server...
```

If no git remote is found, it uses the folder name as the base path and shows a hint to run `starfu deploy` later.

The result is a **clean** structure that doesn't clutter the rest of your project:

```sh
your-project/
  ├── .starfu/
  └── docs/
```

## Commands

### init (default)

Scaffolds a new Starfu project:

```bash
npx starfu [--dir path] [--force]
```

| Option         | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `--dir <path>` | Target output directory (default: current directory) |
| `--force`      | Overwrite existing `.starfu` and `docs` folders    |

### deploy

Configures deployment settings:

```bash
npx starfu deploy
```

This command:
- Detects your GitHub/GitLab repository from git remote
- Shows the site URL and base path that will be used
- Optionally generates a CI workflow file

See the [Deploy Command](./deploy) page for details.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

Scaffold in the current directory:

```bash
npx starfu
```

### Custom Directory

Scaffold into a specific folder:

```bash
npx starfu --dir my-docs
```

This creates:

```
my-docs/
├── .starfu/
└── docs/
```

### Force Overwrite

Re-scaffold an existing project:

```bash
npx starfu --force
```

Without `--force`, the CLI will error if `.starfu` or `docs` already exist.

## Installation

Starfu is designed to be used via `npx` without global installation:

```bash
npx starfu
```

But you can install **globally** if you're planning to use it in several projects:

```bash
npm install -g starfu
```

Your docs will be available at `http://localhost:4321/<repo-name>/`.
