# Vegan Banana Pancakes

Completely plant-based, fluffy pancakes that are just as delicious as the original.

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (or whole wheat)
- 2 tablespoons sugar or maple syrup
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 1/4 cups plant-based milk (oat, almond, or soy)
- 2 ripe bananas, mashed
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted (or vegetable oil)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar or lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Mix the plant-based milk with apple cider vinegar and let sit for 5 minutes to create a "buttermilk" effect.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.

3. In another bowl, combine the milk mixture, mashed bananas, melted coconut oil, and vanilla.

4. Pour wet ingredients into dry and stir until just combined. Let batter rest for 5 minutes.

5. Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat and lightly oil.

6. Pour 1/4 cup batter per pancake onto the pan.

7. Cook for 2-3 minutes until bubbles form and pop on the surface.
