# Protein-Packed Banana Pancakes

A healthier twist with extra protein for a post-workout breakfast or sustained energy.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup oat flour (or blended oats)
- 1 scoop vanilla protein powder (about 30g)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- Pinch of salt
- 2 ripe bananas, mashed
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup Greek yogurt
- 1/4 cup milk (dairy or plant-based)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon honey (optional)

## Instructions

1. Combine oat flour, protein powder, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl.

2. In another bowl, whisk together mashed bananas, eggs, Greek yogurt, milk, vanilla, and honey.

3. Fold wet ingredients into dry ingredients until just combined. The batter will be thicker than regular pancakes.

4. Heat a non-stick pan over medium-low heat and lightly grease.

5. Pour 1/4 cup batter per pancake. These cook slower due to the protein, so be patient.

6. Cook for 3-4 minutes until bubbles appear and edges are firm, then flip.

7. Cook another 2-3 minutes until cooked through.

8. Serve with nut butter, berries, and a drizzle of honey.
