# Classic Banana Pancakes

A fluffy, delicious breakfast staple that's perfect for lazy weekend mornings.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons melted butter
- 2 ripe bananas, mashed
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

2. In a separate bowl, combine milk, egg, melted butter, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract.

3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Don't overmix - a few lumps are fine.

4. Heat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or oil.

5. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan for each pancake.

6. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.

7. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown.

8. Serve warm with maple syrup, sliced bananas, and butter.

## Tips

- Use very ripe bananas for maximum sweetness and flavor
- Don't overmix the batter - this keeps pancakes fluffy
- Keep finished pancakes warm in a 200°F oven while cooking the rest
- Leftover pancakes freeze well for up to 2 months

## Yield

Makes about 8-10 pancakes (serves 3-4 people)
